# Lesson 8 - Automating AI Development with Aider

---

## üìö Project Overview
Welcome to **Lesson 8**, the final lesson in **TandemFlow's AI development course**. In this lesson, we'll explore how to leverage **Aider programmatically** to act as an AI coding assistant. The goal is to develop an entire **Wikipedia Summarization Project** in a **single prompt** using automation techniques. You'll learn how to:

- Configure **Aider for automated coding**.
- Develop a project **entirely through AI-driven prompts**.
- Execute and refine **code generation** in iterations.
- Implement **evaluation mechanisms** for AI-generated code.

By the end of this lesson, you'll see how Aider can be used **at scale** to streamline software development!

## üìå Lesson Breakdown

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Setting Up the Automated Aider Framework**
- Clone the **repository** and open it in your **IDE**.
- Unlike previous projects, this setup is designed for **full automation**.
- Key files:
  - **`Automator.py`** - The main automation script.
  - **`aider_config.json`** - Configuration for Aider instances.
  - **`Agent.py`** - Defines AI-driven development logic.

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Understanding the AI Agent Class**
- **Agent Class** serves as the core of AI-driven development.
- Key functionalities:
  - **`build_structured_prompt()`** - Converts high-level ideas into structured prompts.
  - **`analyze_project_structure()`** - Maps dependencies & file structure.
  - **`generate_code()`** - Uses Aider to generate the codebase.
  - **`evaluate_code()`** - Runs the generated code & detects issues.
  - **`final_review()`** - Assesses whether the output meets specifications.

---

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Running the Automator Script**
- **Configuring the automation script:**
  - Set the **coding model** (e.g., `sonnet`, `DPC`, `AR1`).
  - Define **max iterations** (default: `3`).
  - Specify **execution commands** (for running generated code).
  - Determine **health checks** for long-running applications.

- **Executing the Automator:**
  ```sh
  python auto-aider.py
  ```
- Provide a **high-level project description**, and Aider will auto-generate the complete **Wikipedia Summarization Project**!

---

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Evaluating and Debugging AI-Generated Code**
- Aider generates and **iterates through code improvements** based on evaluations.
- If errors occur, Aider automatically **adjusts the code** in the next iteration.
- Key debugging commands:
  ```sh
  /ask "Why did the script fail?"
  /fix "Resolve the error in utils.py"
  ```
- Example:
  - If the **summary function** isn't correctly implemented, we update it to use **Llama**.
  - We then **rerun the Automator** to regenerate the fixed codebase.

---

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Running the AI-Generated Application**
- Once development completes, **execute the application**:
  ```sh
  python main.py
  ```
- Expected features:
  - Fetches **Wikipedia articles** dynamically.
  - Generates **summaries using LLMs**.
  - Provides **key figures and statistics** from the text.
  - A clean **Flask-based front-end** without reloads.

---

### **6Ô∏è‚É£ Final Tweaks & Lessons Learned**
- While **Aider automates software development**, it still requires **manual adjustments**.
- Key **post-processing** steps:
  - Refining AI-generated **code structure**.
  - Enhancing **LLM prompts** for better accuracy.
  - Debugging **remaining edge cases**.
